# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A Jupyter Notebook project that tracks and visualizes **COVID-19 data worldwide** using the latest dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-19).  

This project provides insights into global trends, top affected countries, and relationships between COVID-19 cases and deaths.

---

## Objectives

- Load and explore COVID-19 data from a reliable source.
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize global trends, top affected countries, and relationships between cases and deaths.
- Draw insights to understand the global impact of COVID-19.

---

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **Pandas** for data handling and manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for plotting line and scatter charts
- **Seaborn** for enhanced visualization styling

## How to Run / View the Project

1. Clone this repository:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project folder and open the notebook:

cd covid19-global-tracker
jupyter notebook


Open covid19_tracker.ipynb and run all cells from top to bottom.
The notebook will automatically fetch the latest COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data.

## Key Features & Visualizations

Global Cases Over Time: Line chart showing worldwide total COVID-19 cases.

Global Deaths Over Time: Line chart showing worldwide total COVID-19 deaths.

Top 10 Countries by Cases: Bar chart highlighting countries most affected by the pandemic.

Total Cases vs Total Deaths: Scatter plot for the latest date, colored by continent.

Summary Statistics: Latest global totals and top countries by cases and deaths.

## Insights / Reflections

Global COVID-19 cases and deaths have distinct waves over time.

Countries with higher total cases generally have higher total deaths, though fatality rates differ.

Visualization helps identify trends, peaks, and the pandemicâ€™s impact across regions.

The tracker is dynamic and updates as new data becomes available.
